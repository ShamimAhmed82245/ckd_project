# CKD Project

This project is a Django web application for comparing different machine learning models on a Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) dataset. The application allows users to select two models, compare their performance using various metrics, and visualize the results with bar charts, pie charts, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

## Supported Models

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KN_model)
- Logistic Regression (LR_model)
- Decision Tree (DT_model)
- Random Forest (RF_model)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM_model)
